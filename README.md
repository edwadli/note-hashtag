# Compiling

Run the `install_dependencies.sh` script to set up submodules, install OCaml, and install third-party libraries.

This script is maintained on Ubuntu 15.04 and OS X 10.11 El Capitan, although it will probably work on Ubuntu 14.x, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and Debian as well.

Once you have the dependencies, just `cd` into the directory you want and `make`.

# Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting is provided for Sublime Text. In Sublime, go to:
Preferences -> Browse Packages -> User
and copy the file (in style/)
note-hashtag.tmLanguage
into that directory.
