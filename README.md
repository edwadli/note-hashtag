# Compiling

Run the `install_dependencies.sh` script to set up submodules, install OCaml, and install third-party libraries.

This script is maintained on Ubuntu 15.04 and OS X 10.11 El Capitan, although it will probably work on Ubuntu 14.x, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and Debian as well.

Once you have the dependencies, just `cd` into the directory you want and `make`.
